    "greedy → simulated annealing → tabu search\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution combines three optimization techniques: Greedy, Simulated Annealing (SA), and Tabu Search. First, a quick initial solution is generated using a greedy approach, which assigns each customer to the nearest depot that can accommodate their demand. Next, Simulated Annealing is applied to iteratively improve the solution by exploring neighboring solutions with a probability of accepting worse solutions, which decreases over time to avoid local minima. Finally, Tabu Search further refines the solution by maintaining a tabu list that prevents revisiting recently explored solutions, encouraging exploration of new, potentially better solutions. Together, these techniques balance exploration and exploitation, leading to an optimized solution for the facility location problem."
